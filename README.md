The idea is pretty simple. A usb security tool with an "lockdown" feature. You pick a USB port and designate it. If connected anywhere else it pulls important files, generates hashes, changes root passwords and disconnects. Something for inexperienced devs when they notice something off. Could even add github repo pulls and locks. IN DEVELOPMENT.
